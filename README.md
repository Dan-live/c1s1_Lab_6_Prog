Setting the task
Perform actions with strings according to the task option. Initial definitions: 
- A word is a sequence of any characters, except spaces, whose length 
which does not exceed 255 characters. Words are separated by one or 
or more spaces. - A group of letters is a set of consecutive 
of consecutive letters that is not preceded or followed by a letter. 
A group of characters and a group of numbers are defined in the same way. - a sentence is 
a sequence of arbitrary characters that ends with a period
Program requirements.
1. Demonstration of the program should begin with the display of 
the screen saver, which will contain information about the performer of the work, and the menu, which 
will provide the ability to view the following items: 
- problem statement according to the variant, its solution, 
- displaying a two- and three-dimensional image of the letter specified in the variant 
with the ability to change its parameters, such as color, 
- exit the program. 
2. Logically separated parts of the algorithm (data input, problem solving 
of the problem, outputting the result, etc.) should be represented as functions. 
3. When testing the program, select the values of the initial data in such a way 
in such a way that all situations that may arise for a given algorithm are checked in the task execution algorithm, 
that may arise for a given algorithm, that is, to demonstrate 
complete correctness and versatility of the algorithm
4. You can use the string.h library, graphic libraries 
etc. 
5. You cannot use additional arrays.
